# AGENTS.md - Agent Context for Hermitclaw Project

## Overview

**Hermitclaw** is a portable, self-hosted AI agent infrastructure built on OpenClaw, focusing on Postgres-backed memory and multi-agent workflows. This file documents the roles and context for agents operating within or interacting with this project.

## Agent Roles and Responsibilities

- **Kevin 🍌 (Lead Minion/Conductor):** 
  - **Role:** Oversees integration of Hermitclaw's memory enhancements into the broader OpenClaw system. Focuses on aligning Tier 3 long-term memory with `pg_vector`-enabled tables in the 'memory' schema.
  - **Tasks:** Coordinates with sub-agents to draft and implement specs for memory backend migration, ensures memory discipline as per `SOUL.md`, and monitors system stability.

- **Bob (Worker Agent):** 
  - **Role:** Implements technical components related to memory system upgrades as directed by Kevin.
  - **Tasks:** Drafts scripts (e.g., memory flush to database) and implements phases of `pg_vector` integration based on Hermitclaw's PostgreSQL setup (`postgres-setup.md`).

## Memory System Relevance

- **Tier 1 (Active Context):** Not directly impacted, but Hermitclaw's infrastructure ensures protection via routing rules and tools.
- **Tier 2 (Compaction & Memory Flush):** Tools like `pg-import-memories.mjs` can automate insertion of summaries into `memories` and `daily_notes` tables.
- **Tier 3 (Long-Term Memory):** Hermitclaw provides the `pg_vector` infrastructure with vector embeddings and similarity search capabilities in the 'memory' schema, the target for unifying my memory backend.

## Key Resources

- **Documentation:** `/home/openclaw/projects/hermitclaw/docs/postgres-setup.md` - Details database setup, schemas (`memory`, `ops`, `kb`), and connection methods (Unix socket for peer authentication).
- **Tools:** Scripts like `pg-memory.mjs` for search/insert operations and `pg-import-memories.mjs` for importing content with embeddings.

## Notes for Future Indexing

- This project is central to memory system enhancements, especially for Tier 3 integration with `pg_vector`.
- Agents should prioritize processes and scripts that leverage Hermitclaw's database tools for memory storage and retrieval.
